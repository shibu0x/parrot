# writer

A skill for terminal AI agents that learns how you write from your own messages to coding agents, then writes tweets, posts, emails and blogs in your voice.

Everything runs locally. `extract.py` reads only the messages you typed from your agents' local history, redacts secrets and emails, and `stats.py` counts your habits. Your profile is saved to `~/.writer/profile.md`.

Reads history from: Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Qwen Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, Kiro, Factory Droid, opencode, Aider.

## Install

```bash
git clone <this repo> ~/writer-skill && ~/writer-skill/install.sh
```

`install.sh` symlinks the skill into every agent it finds (`~/.agents`, `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.gemini`, `~/.qwen`, `~/.copilot`, `~/.cursor`, `~/.factory`, `~/.kiro`, opencode, amp) and shows how many of your messages each agent has.

## Use

```
/writer profile                     # build and show your style profile
/writer tweet <what to write about> # also: thread, linkedin, blog, email, reply, docs
```

## Check

```bash
python3 extract.py --test && python3 stats.py --test
```
